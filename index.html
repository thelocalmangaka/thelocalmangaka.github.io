<p><i>This video, "Squidward: Obsession and Futility", analyzes every episode appearance of Squidward through an absurdist perspective: I try to explain Squidward's cynicism in the context of how he reacts to the absurd and irrational world around him. I try to relate how the current real world can feel whacky, crazy, and out of control like the bizarre world of SpongeBob through Squidward's eyes. And I examine the fundamental relationship between Squidward's cynicism and SpongeBob's optimism, and how this key dynamic plays into Stephen Hillenburg's overall vision.</i></p>
